Cloudchaser
===========

Cloudchaser is a Soundcloud artist reccomendation tool which analyzes the social activity of your favorite artists, including who they follow and whose music they comment on, computing a general directed level of interest and suggesting up-and-coming musicians your favorite musicians are interested in. The analysis is performed by computing a directed graph based on an artist's social activity on Soundcloud, and then page-ranking the artists.
